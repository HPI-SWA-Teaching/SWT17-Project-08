## Beautiful Window Management in Squeak

![Window Acrobatics Title Image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9486619/27054536-8e151cbe-4fc1-11e7-84b3-dae4c9b4b825.png)

Window Acrobatics bundles a number of ways you are used to interacting with your windows and puts them right into your Squeak image.
Current components of Window Acrobatics include

* __The Window Aligner__
  * A tool that lets you align windows to specific parts of your screen easily.
* __The Expose View__
  * An overview of all currently open windows.
* __The Window Switcher__
  * A switching tool that lets you cycle over your windows.

### Installation
Simply drag and drop the *.sar* into your image.

### Usage

You can easily customize all the shortcuts used in Window Acrobatics in the Window Acrobatics section in your Preference Browser -- here are the defaults. 

| Cmd/Alt +     | Action            |
|-------------|-------------------|
